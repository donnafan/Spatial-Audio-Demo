<h1>Demonstrate how the shape of your ear helps you localize sound!</h1>

You'll need a friend to do this demo.
<ol>
<li> You and your friend should stand/sit directly across from each other.</li>
<li> Get your friend to close their eyes.</li>
<li> Clap or snap your fingers in different places and get your friend to point out where the sound is coming from. They should be pretty accurate!</li>
<li> Now ask your friend to squish/distort their ears.</li>
<li> Repeat step 3 - it should be a lot harder to tell between up and down!</li>
<li> Switch roles and see for yourself!</li>
</ol>
