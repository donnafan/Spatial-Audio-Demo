<h1>Demonstrate how the shape of your ear helps you localize sounds coming from above and below</h1>
<h3>Try this with a friend!</h3>
<ol>
<li> You and your friend should stand/sit directly across from each other.</li>
<li> Get your friend to close their eyes.</li>
<li> Clap or snap your fingers in different places and get your friend to <br> 
    point out where the sound is coming from. They should be pretty accurate.</li>
<li> Now ask your friend to squish/distort their ears.</li>
<li> Repeat step 3 - it should be a lot harder to tell between up and down.</li>
<li> Switch roles and see for yourself!</li>
</ol>
